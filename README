This is NCC, the "new" C compiler. It targets the AMD64 architecture.

The compiler is _almost_ ANSI C89 compliant: only struct assignment and
related features (initialization of auto structs, struct arguments and 
return values) are unimplemented. This shortcoming will be addressed soon.

The binary tools work on a non-standard object file format and produce a.out-
style executables. These are documented in obj.h and a.out.h respectively.

NCC includes:

ncc: compiler driver.
ncpp: an ANSI C89 compliant C preprocessor.
ncc1: the C compiler proper, produces assembly output
nas: accepts 16/32/64-bit Intel syntax assembly and produces .o object.
nld: the object linker - combines .o files into a.out executables.
nobj: object/executable inspector. 
nexec: tool to run ncc a.out binaries on 64-bit Intel/AMD Linux systems
