This is NCC, the "new" C compiler. It is intended to be used as the system
compiler for BSD/64 (my port of pre-Reno 4.3BSD to Intel/AMD 64-bit desktops).
The compiler and its tools are fully functional and have been fairly well-
tested to work correctly, though they are works-in-progress. In particular,
the optimizer is quite minimal, and there is much work to be done there.

ncc: compiler driver.
ncpp: an ANSI C89 compliant C preprocessor.
ncc1: the C compiler proper, produces assembly output
nas: accepts 16/32/64-bit Intel syntax assembly and produces .o object.
nld: the object linker - combines .o files into a.out executables.
nobj: object/executable inspector. 

These are all original works and are BSD-licensed. See LICENSE and comments.

The dialect of C accepted by the compiler is basically pre-ANSI (K&R 1978) 
with some common extensions (e.g., separate member space) and a few minor 
"fixes". See the DIALECT file for specifics. Modifying the front end to accept
and enforce ANSI C instead would be relatively straightforward, perhaps only 
two days' work, but I haven't found any compelling reason to do so.
