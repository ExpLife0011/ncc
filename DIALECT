The compiler accepts "classic" C as described in K&R (1978), with
a few changes as detailed below.

==========
EXTENSIONS
==========

Most of these were common extensions that made it into the ANSI standard.


* 'unsigned' is extended to all integer types.

K&R only mentions 'unsigned int'. NCC extends this qualifier to all 
integral types, including 'char', which is signed by default.


* Separate member namespaces.

'struct' and 'union' types each enclose a unique namespace, so members of
different aggregate types need not have different names. 


* Separate tag namespaces.

'struct foo' and 'union foo' refer to different types, even in the same scope.
There's really no reason to have these namespaces overlap, and I suspect it was
merely an artifact of dmr's original C compiler that they do (the same could
be said about shared member namespaces). Shared tag namespaces are a nuisance
to enforce, and so the compiler doesn't bother.


* Arbitrarily-typed bitfields.

The compiler allows bit fields to have any integral type: the size of the type 
limits the number of bits that are permitted and sets the alignment requirement 
of the word that contains field. Also, the signedness of the field is honored.


=======
CHANGES
=======

These are intentional changes to the syntax and semantics of K&R C. These
are fairly minor but make the language more consistent. (ANSI attempts to
address some of the issues addressed here, but they were more constrained 
by backwards-compatibility concerns.)


* Floating-point types

K&R basically treats 'float' as a kind of short 'double': 'float' types are
promoted to 'double' before just about any operation, in the same way that a 
'short' is promoted to 'int'. This behavior is suboptimal on AMD64.

NCC doesn't have a 'double' type; its double-precision type is instead called
'long float', and its relationship to 'float' is the same as that between 
'long' and 'int'. A 'float' is coerced to a 'long float' only during the 
"usual conversions": when one of the operands to a binary operator is 'long 
float', the other is promoted to 'long float'. Note that this means that
function arguments and return values of type 'float' are distinct from their
'long float' analogs.

All floating-point constants are assumed to be 'float' unless suffixed with 
'L' or 'l', in which case they are 'long float'.

* Integer constants

'long' integer constants must be explicitly suffixed with 'L' or 'l'. This 
is for parity with the floating-point types and to avoid inadvertent long
constants. Both K&R and ANSI rules for classifying constants are dependent 
on the value and base of the constant, as well as the implementation-specific
ranges of the integral types.
